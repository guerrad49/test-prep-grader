# test-prep-grader

classes.py contains TestClass. The objective is for the user to be able to grade a standardized test (only ACT for now) and acquire desired data such as mistakes made and score(s). The idea is to automate the task of checking by hand versus an online answer key. TestClass utilizes PyPDF2 to acquire answers keys from a free online source. The user will created a random student string or store answers in a string which TestClass can check using built-in methods.
